# KNN_from_scratch_Python
Implementation of the K-NN algorithm for binary classification from scratch in Python

This assignment is intended to build the following skills:
1. Implementation of the brute force K-NN algorithm for binary classification
2. Data pre-processing and feature selection techniques
3. Model evaluation techniques

In order to carry out this, we will:

1. Implement two distance metrics (Euclidean and Manhattan)
2. Implement the brute-force K-NN algorithm
3. Implement a cross-validation function
4. Apply scaling to the dataset
5. Perform feature selection
6. Evaluate the model
